This repository contains two projects. One is DoubleCharErasure, which is an efficient implementation of erasure coding based on RS codes. 3x faster than the library Jerasure of the implementation RS codes. 
Another one HitchhikerXor is an implementation of Hitchhiker-XOR for efficient I/O for recovery, which contains a simple implementation and an acceleration with OpenMP.
The two projects was developed under the support of National Natural Science Foundation of Chine under Grant 62002240.
